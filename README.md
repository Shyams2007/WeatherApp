# WeatherApp
I have developed an weather fetch project to see the current weather of a city. The app displays the weather for the current city and gives suggestions for holiday option for that place.

This module uses the "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather" to get the weather data.

**Installation instructions**

To clone my project into Visual Studio Code using source control:

Navigate to Source Control on the left toolbar, click on "Clone Repository"

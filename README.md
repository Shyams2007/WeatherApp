# WeatherApp
I have developed an weather fetch project to see the current weather of a city. The app displays the weather for the current city and gives suggestions for holiday option for that place.

This module uses the "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather" to get the weather data.

**Installation instructions**

To clone my project into Visual Studio Code using source control:

Navigate to Source Control on the left toolbar, click on "Clone Repository"
Enter in the URL of this repo to download https://github.com/Shyams2007/WeatherApp


**Ensure you have Python on your system**

**Step 1: Install Python**
Download Python:

Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

**Run the Installer:**

During installation, ensure you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
Choose the default settings or customize the installation (e.g., select a specific directory or install additional tools like pip).
Verify Installation:

**Open a terminal or command prompt.**
Type: python --version or python3 --version
You should see the Python version displayed.

Open a new terminal, and make sure you have navigated to the 'WeatherApp' folder

Setting up a virtual environment (optional but advisable) (You can replace env with any name, though venv will be used in the instructions})

For macOS/linux users, Run the following commands:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
For Windows users using Powershell, Run the following commands:
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\Activate.ps1 For Windows users using Command Prompt, Run the following commands:
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\Activate.bat
